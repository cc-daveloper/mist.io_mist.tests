  Scenario: Production ssh testing
    Given I am logged in to mist.core
    When I visit the Machines page after the counter has loaded
    Then I search for the mayday machine
    When I click the mayday machine
    And I clear the machines search bar
    And I expect the "machine" edit form to be visible within max 5 seconds
    Then I wait for the graphs to appear
